# CitiZen

Our planet is changing as we all know it and the main reason is us. Because of that we have to do something to help it. In fact many companies and associations are moving in this direction, for example ONU has made a Social Sustainable Development Agenda of Goals to be completed for 2030. With the Coronavirus pandemic, we saw that some of these Agenda 2030’s points have been taken into severe consideration by the people. So we noticed a real change from them in favour of the Sustainable Development Goals, with an increasing amount of people that decided to take action in that regard.
And on those principles, the Social Empowerment, we based our app: CitiZen.
