# CitiZen

Our planet is changing as we all know it and the main reason is us. Because of that we have to do something to help it. In fact many companies and associations are moving in this direction, for example ONU has made a Social Sustainable Development Agenda of Goals to be completed for 2030. With the Coronavirus pandemic, we saw that some of these Agenda 2030’s points have been taken into severe consideration by the people. So we noticed a real change from them in favour of the Sustainable Development Goals, with an increasing amount of people that decided to take action in that regard.
And on those principles, the Social Empowerment, we based our app: CitiZen.

We want our users to be completely at ease in our app and so we provide the users with multiple login choices: they can either login via email and password or they can use the Apple/Google sign in. Since our app is structured in a social way, we were concerned about the privacy, that is why we have been particularly mindful about this topic.

Our app is based on Call to Actions, with the possibility to either join or create new ones. By completing a Call to Action you get a badge, that allows you to rise the chart and increase your level. Through the chart you can look at other people’s profiles and follow them to be updated about their activities.

One of the first future implentations we would like to implements is a Machine Learning Model about Call to Actions, based on previous users activities. We also would increase and optimizie the conpect of level and rewards, And implement a geolocalization about the user, in this way he can interacts with more ineherent call to actions regarding his territory. As last thing we would increase the social face of the community, by adding for example, comments, likes, and sharings.
